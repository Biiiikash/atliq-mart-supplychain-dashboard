# 📦 AtliQ Mart – Supply Chain Delivery Performance Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** analyzing the delivery performance of AtliQ Mart, a fictional FMCG distributor. 
The report provides actionable insights into order fulfillment efficiency across cities, customers, and products,
focusing on key delivery metrics like OT (On-Time), IF (In-Full), OTIF (On-Time In-Full), and fill rates.

- Track delivery performance across geography, customer segments, and SKUs
- Identify performance gaps against OT, IF, and OTIF targets
- Highlight delay patterns and quantify average delay severity
- Provide a clean, executive-level view of supply chain reliability

## 📊 Key Findings

- The **average delivery delay** for late orders is **1.71 days**, calculated using a weighted average.
-  On-time deliveries are excluded to preserve analytical accuracy.
- **Lotus Mart** and **Acclaimed Stores**, despite being among the **top 5 customers by order volume**,
- recorded **the lowest OT, IF, and OTIF performance**, indicating poor fulfillment service to high-value clients.
- City-level metrics show consistent underperformance with actual OTIF falling far below target benchmarks.
- Product-level LFR and VFR performance is generally strong, but selected SKUs show variability across months.
